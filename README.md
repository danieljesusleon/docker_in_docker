How to Install Docker Inside a Docker Container (DinD)

In this guide, we will go through the steps to install Docker inside a Docker container (DinD) using the Ubuntu container image and Docker Compose.
Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need the following:

    A machine with Docker installed
    Basic knowledge of Docker and Docker Compose

Steps

    Start by creating a new Ubuntu container:

    arduino

docker run -it ubuntu

Update the package list and install necessary dependencies:

sql

apt-get update
apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common

Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:

arduino

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

Add the Docker repository to your system:

bash

add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

Install Docker:

sql

apt-get update
apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

Verify that Docker is installed correctly:

css

docker --version

Install Docker Compose:

bash

curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/<VERSION>/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Note: Replace <VERSION> with the latest version of Docker Compose.

Verify that Docker Compose is installed correctly:

css

    docker-compose --version

That's it! You now have Docker and Docker Compose installed inside your Docker container. You can use Docker Compose to manage and deploy your applications inside the container.
Conclusion

In this guide, we have shown you how to install Docker inside a Docker container (DinD) using the Ubuntu container image and Docker Compose. By following these steps, you can easily set up a development environment inside a Docker container and deploy your applications with ease.
